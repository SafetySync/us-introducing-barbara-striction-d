            <h1 class="oykhfzoajz"><strong>Introducing Barbara O'Neill: Championing Hypertension Awareness and Management</strong></h1>
            <p class="qwaoqrhklsjjd"><strong>Meet Barbara O'Neill, a dedicated advocate and educator whose passion for health and wellness knows no bounds. With a background in healthcare and a heart for helping others, Barbara has devoted her career to raising awareness about hypertension and empowering individuals to take control of their blood pressure.</strong></p>

            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk">Hypertension, often referred to as high blood pressure, affects millions of people worldwide and is a leading risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and other serious health conditions. Despite its prevalence, hypertension is often misunderstood and underestimated, leading to significant health consequences for those affected.<br><br><em></em> Enter Barbara O'Neill. Armed with knowledge, compassion, and a relentless drive to make a difference, Barbara has become a leading voice in the fight against hypertension. Through her advocacy work, educational initiatives, and community outreach efforts, she is working tirelessly to change the narrative surrounding hypertension and improve outcomes for those living with this condition.</p>
			 
			 <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk">But Barbara's impact extends far beyond raising awareness. She is also committed to providing practical support and resources to individuals struggling to manage their blood pressure. Whether through informative workshops, online resources, or one-on-one consultations, Barbara empowers individuals with the knowledge and tools they need to monitor their blood pressure, make healthier lifestyle choices, and effectively manage their hypertension.<br><br><em></em> In a world where chronic diseases like hypertension continue to pose significant challenges to public health, Barbara O'Neill stands as a beacon of hope and guidance. Her unwavering dedication to hypertension awareness and management serves as an inspiration to us all, reminding us that with education, support, and determination, we can overcome even the most formidable health challenges.</p>

            <div class="ikpledqzksgwf"><em class="kxxrhhwtfk">Barbara O'Neill</em></div>

            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk"><strong>- Barbara O'Neill, you said clean blood vessels are the key to good health. Why?<br><br>‍</strong>- It’s very simple. Activity of organs and systems in the body depends on the quality of blood circulation. The circulatory system delivers nutrients and oxygen to all organs in the body and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic products from the blood. At a young age, we move a lot and our blood vessels are fresh, elastic and clean, so our bodies receive plenty of nutrients. As we age, we tend to move less and blood vessels start getting clogged. It is caused by many different reasons adverse factors (such as smoking, unhealthy eating, poor environment, sedentary lifestyle) and also due to nature (lipid deposition, aging processes taking place in all organisms).<br><em><br>‍‍</em>
              What does 'dirty' blood vessel mean? Imagine some pipes full of rust that happen? The water pressure increases, and the water tastes so good. The same thing happens with blood vessels. When cholesterol or other substances build up on the inner lining of blood vessels, the pressure increases ( Impaired blood vessel function is the main cause of hypertension! ), eventually, the blood blends with impurities and the blood circulation becomes deranged. As a result, all organs and systems of the body get affected, including the skin.

              <br><em><br>‍‍‍‍</em>‍‍‍‍If you are careful and keep your blood vessels clean, you can live for at least 110 years and your body will be working smoothly without any pain in your organs or joints. In other words, cleaning your blood vessels can prolong lifespan and improve your health. This is no longer a hypothesis, it’s a tested method. I have recommended this method to my patients and I practice it too. Everyone who follows my advice has very high chances of outliving their peers.<br></p>
            
            <a href="{offer_link}" target="_blank"><img src="./index_files/2.jpeg" alt="" class="podjvuqiitve"></a>
            <div class="ikpledqzksgwf"><em>This is how the blood vessels gradually become dirty If you're over 40 but have never cleaned your blood vessels, then your blood vessels are definitely full of impurities. This could have already affected your health or maybe the process is just about to start.</em></div>

            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk"><strong>- Why are dirty vessels dangerous?<br></strong><br>‍- As I said, the entire body gets affected, starting with organs and systems that are directly linked to blood circulation - the cardiovascular system.
              <br><br>Impurities from blood vessels may cause the following diseases:</p>
            
            <div class="hwzkfjlvpssugf kljszkhhaclzww">
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Ischemic heart disease</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>This disease is caused by frequent anemia in coronary arteries, which is caused by impurities in the blood vessels.</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Atherosclerosis</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Blood vessels no longer work smoothly: small blood vessels are completely blocked and the main blood vessels are clogged by bad cholesterol.</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Stroke</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Anemia to the brain tissue causes nerve end points to stop working, leading to loss of function.</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Hypertension</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Impurities from blood vessels cause vascular narrowing and hypertension.</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Varicose veins</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>They appear inside the body, not just on the legs (which is alarming for women). Hemorrhoids are the result of varicose veins.</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Venous and arterial thrombosis</strong></div>
               <div class="dlqiyfcacdqhz"><strong>Deposition of impurities in the blood vessels forms thrombus and causes blood vessels to fail, which can cause a group of cells to die. If the thrombus is not aligned and enters the bloodstream, it is possible to block the blood vessels in the heart, which in 75% of cases will cause death of the patient.</strong></div>
            </div>

            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk">This is very common. Doctors are well aware of this, and they know that it's necessary to clean blood vessels. However, the healthcare industry neglects it for some reason. Majority of doctors prescribe pills to lower blood pressure to patients who suffer from high blood pressure. However, this is not a cure, just a temporary treatment. It is absolutely necessary to clean blood vessels, it's practiced by people over 35-37 for more than half of a century. Every patient is aware of the importance of cleaning blood vessels. I always wonder why we do not apply this method in our country.

              <br><em><br>‍</em>‍<strong>- Are there any symptoms that help to recognize the presence of build-up in blood vessels?<br></strong><em><br>‍</em>- Yes, of course. The main symptoms are:</p>
            <ul role="list" class="list">
               <li>Migraine</li>
              <li>Memory decline</li>
              <li>Chronic fatigue</li>
              <li>Insomnia</li>
              <li>Problems in sex</li>
              <li>Vision and hearing disorders</li>
              <li>High blood pressure</li>
              <li>Respiratory failure and angina</li>
              <li>Pale foot skin</li>
              <li>Pain in muscles and joints</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk">Whether or not you have one of these symptoms, you need to clean your blood vessels at least once in 2 years after you have turned 35. Certainly, it will keep you in good health for a very long time.

              <br><br>‍Impurities tend to build up in blood vessels, especially in the elderly. To have healthy vessels, avoid foods rich in cholesterol because it builds up on the walls of your arteries over time.

              <br><br>‍<strong>- Please share your secret to maintaining clean blood vessels.

                <br><br></strong>- Previously, the process of cleaning up blood cells took me several months. I was collecting medical herbs in the market or had to order them from online shops. Then I would drink them for a certain period of time. Now, I don't need to do this anymore, because my colleagues from the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases have created a good and inexpensive remedy for cleaning blood vessels: "<a href="{offer_link}" target="_blank" class=""><strong class="offer1">Striction D</strong></a>". This product helps regulate blood pressure and treat hypertension. This is a great medication which helps me achieve my goal of cleaning blood vessels.</p>
            <div>
               <a href="{offer_link}"><img src="./index_files/StrictionD.png" width="350" alt="" class="podjvuqiitve"></a>

            </div>
            <p class="izdkfzkhzxtjlkk">This drug does not contain chemicals but only concentrated extracts of medicinal herbs that clean blood cells. <br><br> Recently, many patients ask me about having a dialysis procedure. I always recommend try this product before considering having dialysis. I think it's very effective. <br><br> The Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases publishes official statistics about clinical studies of this amazing product. 2000 patients who participated in the study, were successfully treated with "<strong class="offer1">Striction D</strong>" and observed positive impact on blood pressure.
<br><br>‍<strong>Results of the study:</strong></p>
            <ul role="list" class="list">
               <li>Normalized arterial blood pressure after 1-2 days of using the drug - 99% of cases</li>
              <li>Stabilized heart rate after the treatment was ended - 97% of cases</li>
              <li>Blood vessels completely cleaned of cholesterol after the treatment was ended- 99% of patients</li>

            On the sidelines of the interview, Ms. O'Neill also confessed that she enjoys gardening and helping her children, even though they are already retired. Her husband is already 99 years old and also follows this method to keep his blood vessels clean. They both believe that is what keeps them alive and active.</p>
